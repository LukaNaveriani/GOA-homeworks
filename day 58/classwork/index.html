<h2>Bottle Design</h2>
<p>The bottle design is elegant and modern, a true reflection of the Chanel aesthetic. It is a simple square shape with clean lines and a clear glass structure, giving the perfume an almost architectural feel. The fragrance is housed in a delicate, transparent bottle with a gold cap, which echoes the sophistication and timelessness that Chanel is known for.</p>

<section id="how to wear">
  <h2>How to wear </h2>
  <p>Apply to Pulse Points: To make the scent last longer, apply the perfume to pulse points where your skin is warm. This includes the wrists, behind the ears, and the base of your throat. Heat helps to diffuse and amplify the fragrance.

    Don’t Rub It In: After applying perfume to your wrists, avoid rubbing them together. This can break down the fragrance and diminish its longevity.
    
    Layering with Skincare: For longer-lasting wear, you can layer the fragrance with a complementary scented body lotion or oil. This creates a base for the perfume to cling to.
    
    Spray at a Distance: Hold the bottle about 6-8 inches from your body when spraying. This allows the perfume to diffuse more evenly, creating a more subtle, enveloping scent cloud.
    
    Occasions: Gabrielle is versatile enough for both daytime and evening wear. Its brightness and freshness make it perfect for daytime outings, office wear, and casual events. The floral richness also gives it an elegant touch, making it suitable for evening wear, especially when you want to exude a refined, sophisticated aura.
    
    Season: Gabrielle is a great fragrance for spring and summer due to its light and airy floral composition, but it can also be worn year-round, especially in milder or warmer climates.</p>
